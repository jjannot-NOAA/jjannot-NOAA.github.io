# Overview

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `phlbbycatcher` is to provide estimates of Pacific halibut
(*Hippoglossus stenolepis*) bycatch mortality in U.S. west coast
fisheries (WA, OR, CA). These bycatch estimates are presented each
August to the PFMC (for September Breifing Book) and in October (afer
September PFMC Meeting) to the International Pacific Halibut Commission
(IPHC). NWFSC Observer Program data from any particular year are
typically not fully QAQC’d and finalized for use in analysis until late
spring of the following year. Thus, the annual P. halibut mortality
report only presents data thru 31st December of the previous year (e.g.,
the 2020 report would have data thru 2019).

# Scope

We currently provide estimates for Federal fisheries that carry
observers, electronic monitoring equipment, or both. We also provide
estimates for state-managed fisheries that carry observers.
